Where to find stuff:
====================
[Summary](https://www.dcs.bbk.ac.uk/intranet/index.php/BSc_ISM_Projects_and_BSc_Computing_Projects)


- Expenditure Analyser;
- a budgeting tool, which could for example start a budget based on what data has been entered by the user;
- a 'budget checker', where it compares current expenditure against the planned budget;
- (possibly) a web interface, so that this could be accessed from a browser;
- the already discussed expenditure analyser;

- DBPedia



RDF

[RDF Primer](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-Introduction)
[RDF4J](http://docs.rdf4j.org/rdf-tutorial/)

- can we not use RDF predicates for the categorisation of the expenditure
  analyser? e.g., `<sainsburys> <is a> <supermarket>`, so query the web for
  information such as this: `<lloyds> <is a> <bank>`, etc.



26/06/2017: Project Briefing
============================

## Stages:
- Sketch out an idea for a project (something basic, so that you will have
  something to discuss):

### Records System
- like Doost, but change religious organisation to club to try to avoid
  people's bias.

### Expenditure Analyser
- Expand on it. Maybe make it large enough so that it can be made into a
  project for which 10,000 words could be written.


Timeline
--------

### Find a supervisor
- choose someone who you get along with. they need to help you write the report.

### Submit a project proposal
### Carry out the project
### Submit the project report
- this is the most important part of your project.
  - doesn't matter how good your code is, they will look at the report to see
    what you've done.


Stages in detail:
-----------------
(from [here](http://www.dcs.bbk.ac.uk/~oded/ProjectTut/BSc-Project-Briefing-2017-18.docx))

### The project Proposal 
The project proposal forms the basis for the conduct of the project, although
often elements of the project change as progress is made and information is
gathered. Any substantial deviation from the proposal must be discussed and
agreed with the supervisor. It is up to the student to carry out the work for
the project and produce a coherent project report by the required date.

### The role of the supervisor
In general the supervisor will provide encouragement and guidance to the
student, comment on the project proposal, and read and comment on drafts of the
report.

#### Student-Supervisor Communication
Students vary in the frequency of their communications with their supervisor.
Much will depend on the milestones set out in the project proposal but as a
minimum it is envisaged that a student will communicate with his or her
supervisor as follows:
- in connection with the approval of the project proposal,
- after a few weeks of work to firm up/amend the proposal,
- about midway through the project to consider progress made and discuss how
  best to proceed,
- and finally to discuss the first draft of the report in time for any
  recommended changes to be acted upon before submission.

#### Supervisor marking
It should be remembered that although the supervisor provides a mark for the
project this is only one opinion as to its merits. There is a second marker and
an External Examiner, and it is the Examination Board that awards the final
mark. It is therefore conceivable, although hopefully rare, that a project
fails despite the opinion and guidance of the supervisor.



### plagiarism:
- you cannot take large portions of text from other stuff, even if you quote
  it.



## Project report:
- around 12,000 words;
- be concise;

- [Project Examples](https://www.dcs.bbk.ac.uk/intranet/index.php/BSc_Example_Reports)
  - look at them for inspiration only. Don't try to copy the structure;
  - there's no silver bullet.

The project report mainly determines the mark awarded for the project. It is
possible  to do a marvelous piece of research or write a brilliant program, but
nevertheless obtain a low mark because the report does not match the rest of
the work. So allow enough time to do a good job on the write-up and to respond
to the comments of the supervisor. Experience indicates that a minimum of six
weeks is required. Examiners are wont to trot out that well worn phrase "at the
end of the day it is the project as it sits on the library shelf that reflects
on the institution", meaning that it is difficult to award marks for good work
performed but which has not been reflected in the report.

Some supervisors suggest that you write up as you go along. This minimises the
workload at the end. Much of the report can be written up before the final work
is completed, e.g. the introduction and the literature review. You are advised
to make detailed notes on the articles, books, web pages and other sources of
information that you use as you go along. It may be necessary to purchase some
specialist books or other materials rather than rely on the library or on
inter-library loans.

Write the report, not for your supervisor, but as if you are addressing the
External Examiner, i.e. someone you do not know and who knows nothing about
your project. Set out the problem, the context, etc. Do not assume that the
reader already knows about your project. Write in a detached style and avoid
excessive use of personal pronouns such as I, you, me, my, etc. Write clearly,
paying attention to sentence construction, grammar and spelling. Poor
presentation will mar an otherwise good report. You are advised to get a friend
or colleague to read the report and comment on it before submission.
Typographical and other minor errors also detract from the work, as does the
incorrect reference to, and numbering of, tables and diagrams, etc. It is
surprising how often this happens.



## Type 3: Information Systems Development
- you need to write about the software engineering aspect;



## Criteria for a Project
- do not promise more than you can deliver at proposal stage;



## When it comes to making a decision, if you have trouble making one, choose the one which you know will be a mistake. Then fail. Then learn from your mistake.



## If you're spending up to 5 hours trying to solve something, ask for help.



Writing the report:
===================
- assume the person knows very little;
- write mostly in third person (not forbidden to use first person in
  moderation).



## Top-Down Description:
- A top down description starts from the generic and ends up in the specifics.



## Bottom-up description
- starts with the specifics and ends in the generics
  - I used this tool, because...



## Writing conclusion:
- explain what the difficulty of the project was: "there's this really cool
  feature I know how to implement, but don't have time"
