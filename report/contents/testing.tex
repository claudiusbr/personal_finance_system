\section{Testing} \label{sec:Testing}

\textbf{TODO: write about why I chose BDD as my form of TDD, if there's space
write about the BehaviourTester class. Include Scala's infix notation as one of

\textbf{TODO: write about how there is very limited testing in the presentation
layer due to the fact that I do not have much experience with testing front
end}
