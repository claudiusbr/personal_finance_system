\section{Testing} \label{sec:Testing}

\textbf{TODO: write about why I chose BDD as my form of TDD, if there's space
write about the BehaviourTester class. Include Scala's infix notation as one of
the reasons}

\textbf{TODO: write about how there is very limited testing in the presentation
layer due to the fact that I do not have much experience with testing front
end}


\textbf{TODO: talk about how testing for the persistence layer was done with
MySql because the present version uses a local db, but that in the future for
performance reasons they should be done using a self-generated portable db
version instead (such as H2)}
