\section{Testing} \label{sec:Testing}

\textbf{TODO: write about why I chose BDD as my form of TDD, if there's space
write about the BehaviourTester class. Include Scala's infix notation as one of
the reasons}

\textbf{TODO: write about how there is very limited testing in the presentation
layer due to the fact that I do not have much experience with testing front
end}


\textbf{TODO: talk about how testing for the persistence layer was done with
MySql because the present version uses a local db, but that in the future for
performance reasons they should be done using a self-generated portable db
version instead (such as H2)}

\textbf{TODO: had to make a decision when testing the persistence regarding the
reloading of the whole DB from the dump after performing Create/Update/Delete only.
Reloading it every time using `before` was just taking too long, so to improve
performance I redid it in an unelegant way. The alternative of having one test suite for 
reading and another one for writing was not working also, as many problems were happening,
possibly due to so many classes overwriting the database concurrently}
