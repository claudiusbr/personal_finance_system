\section{Introduction} \label{sec:Introduction}

Vaasen et al. (2009 \cite[cited][p.~8]{Boczko:2012:IAI:2331376}) suggests that
an accounting information system's main purpose is to provide information to
internal and external stakeholders. Although this refers to accounting systems
for business, it could be argued that the same concept could be applied for
personal finance systems -- except that, in this case, the main stakeholder
would be the individual using the system for their personal finances (that is,
the user). In fact, one of the most widely known accounting systems available
in the market, Quicken\texttrademark, was conceived around the idea that there
should be a more efficient and less tedious way to organise one's personal
financial information than doing it manually (\cite{quicken2017about}). This
project has been developed based on these ideas.

Fowler (1997, Chapter 1, Section 1.3) \nocite{fowler1997analysis} defines a
pattern as ``an idea that has been useful in one context and will probably be
useful in others''. This project will therefore attempt to utilise patterns
where appropriate in order to prove this concept, and as an attempt to make use
of the experience already acquired in the domain (or domains) in question.
