\section{Appendix III: How to Build and Run the Application} \label{appendix3}

This is also available from the GitHub Repository for this project,
\href{https://github.com/claudiusbr/personal_finance_system}{here}.

As this is a list of instructions, some of it will be in an imperative voice.

\subsection{What is needed}
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    SBT 1.1.1 (can be downloaded from \href{http://sdkman.io/}{SDKMAN}

  \item
    Scala 2.12.4 (can be downloaded with SBT, or from
    \href{http://sdkman.io/}{SDKMAN}

  \item
    MySQL
    \begin{itemize}
      \item
        also, the \texttt{schema.sql} file, which should be included in the accompanying USB, but also can be downloaded from \href{https://github.com/claudiusbr/personal_finance_system/tree/master/code/original_db_schemas/mysql}{here}.

      \item
        and the \texttt{test\_schema.sql}, which should also be included in the USB stick, or downloaded from \href{https://github.com/claudiusbr/personal_finance_system/tree/master/code/original_db_schemas/mysql}{here}.
    \end{itemize}

  \item
    The \texttt{config.properties} file for the main application, which is also in the USB, or can be downloaded from \href{https://github.com/claudiusbr/personal_finance_system/tree/master/code}{here}.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item
        within the file, the \texttt{MySqlUrl} property value needs to be
        replaced by the URL of the database using to run it.
    \end{itemize}


  \item
    The \texttt{testprops} and \texttt{testtextfile} files, which are required
    to run the tests (they should be in the USB, or can be downloaded from
    \href{https://github.com/claudiusbr/personal_finance_system/tree/master/code/src/test}{here}.

  \item
    A \texttt{private.properties} file containing the MySQL username and password for
    the user that can access the two database schemas for this project:
    \texttt{personal\_finance\_schema} and \texttt{test\_personal\_finance}

    \begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
      MySqlUsername=username
      MySqlPassword=password
    \end{lstlisting}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Building and Running it}
\subsubsection{set up the project}
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    clone or copy the source files into an empty folder, then \texttt{cd} into
    the root folder for the code (the one containing the \texttt{build.sbt} file);

  \item
    create the \texttt{private.properties} file mentioned above, and save it in
    the root folder;

  \item
    make sure the \texttt{config.properties} is in the root directory

  \item
    make sure the \texttt{testprops} and \texttt{testtextfile} files are in the
    \texttt{src/test} directory;

  \item
    add your username and password to it, if you haven't yet;
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Set up MySql}
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    create a database schema called \texttt{personal\_finance\_system};

  \item
    create a database schema called \texttt{test\_personal\_finance};

  \item
    give the user on \texttt{private.properties} access to writing to them;

  \item
    Load the schemas into mysql

    \begin{lstlisting}
    $ mysql -u username -p personal_finance_system < schema.sql
    $ mysql -u username -p test_personal_finance < test_schema.sql
    \end{lstlisting}
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Run SBT from the root folder}
\begin{lstlisting}
$ cd personal_finance_system/code
$ sbt run
\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{How to use it}
Make sure your bank statements are in a csv format, and that the column names
match the below exactly (non-case sensitive, though):
\begin{lstlisting}
date,description,amount
... , ... , ...
...
\end{lstlisting}

As this tends to be the trend with bank statements (or at least mine), all
income should be negative, and all expenditure positive, so if you are
uploading either bank or credit card statements, make sure all income and
expenditure is exactly with these signs.
