\section{Development Method} \label{sec:DevelopmentMethod}
For this project, an approach similar to that adopted by Bennett et al.
(\citeyear[][p.~77]{bennett2010object}) regarding methodology will be employed,
where no specific named methodology is espoused, but concepts of
object-oriented analysis and design shall be applied, in an iterative and
incremental fashion, using UML. More details about which concepts were used and
the methodologies which originated them can be found in the following
subsections.

\subsection{The use of Universal Modelling Language (UML) constructs}
\label{sec:Introduction.methodology.uml}

UML is a modelling language created with the intention of providing system
architects, software engineers and developers with a common set of modelling
tools, with a defined syntax, which would help them better analyse and design
software-based systems, and to model business and similar processes
(\cite[][p.~43]{omg2015uml}). It defines several constructs which will be
employed throughout this report in order to model the specifications of the
system, such as:
\begin{description}
  \item[Use Case diagrams]
    As a useful, high level tool to document users' requirements
    (\cite[][p.~138]{bennett2010object}), use case diagrams have been used to
    develop the requirements model of the system.

  \item[Activity diagrams]

  \item[Class diagrams]
    
  \item[Sequence diagrams]
\end{description}


\subsection{Requirements Capture Methods} \label{sec:DevelopmentMethod.RequirementsCapture}
Due to the nature of the system being for personal rather than commercial use
-- that is, by individuals rather than business entities -- the usual fact
finding techniques do not apply specifically well. However, the closest match
identified to the methods utilised has been with `Knowledge Acquisition'. This
relates to the process of capturing knowledge from an expert
(\cite[][p.~150]{bennett2010object}). In this particular case, though perhaps
not qualifying as an expert, the author's qualification and experience in
accounting and bookkeeping was used to capture the main requirements.

\subsection{Design}
Where appropriate, analysis and design patterns will be used.

Fowler (\citeyear[][Section~1.3]{fowler1997analysis}) defines a
pattern as ``an idea that has been useful in one context and will probably be
useful in others''. This project will therefore attempt to utilise patterns
where appropriate in order to prove this concept, and as an attempt to make use
of the experience already acquired in the domain (or domains) in question.
