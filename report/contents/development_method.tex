\section{Development Method} \label{sec:DevelopmentMethod}
For this project, an approach similar to that adopted by Bennett et al. (2010,
p. 77) \nocite{bennett2010object} regarding methodology will be employed, where
no specific named methodology is espoused, but concepts of object-oriented
analysis and design shall be applied, in an iterative and incremental fashion,
using UML.

\subsection{Universal Modelling Language (UML)}
\label{sec:Introduction.methodology.uml}

UML is a modelling language created with the intention of providing system
architects, software engineers and developers with a common set of modelling
tools with a defined syntax which would help them better analyse, design and
implement software-based systems, and to model business and similar processes
(\cite[][p.~43]{omg2015uml}). It defines several constructs which will be
employed throughout this report in order to model the specifications of the
system, such as:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Use Case diagrams;

  \item
    Activity diagrams;

  \item
    Class diagrams;
    
  \item
    Sequencec diagrams;
\end{itemize}
