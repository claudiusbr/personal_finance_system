\section*{Abstract} \label{sec:Abstract}
Personal finance systems exist in abundance nowadays, from open source to
proprietary ones. They all tend to revolve around a basic common theme:
providing accurate information about an individual's income and expenditure.
Beyond this, they tend to vary in which features are implemented. The system
designed and built for this project focuses on the use of the bookkeeping
principle of double entry and the concept of pattern matching to find effective
ways to categorise a user's expenditure, and provide them with relevant
financial information to assist in decision making.
