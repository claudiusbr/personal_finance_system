\section{Appendix I} \label{appendix1}

Bennett et al.
(\citeyear[][pp.~140-142]{bennett2010object}) categorises requirements as being
of three types:

\begin{description} \item[Functional Requirements]
    The system's functionality -- what it is expected to do.
    
  \item[Non-functional Requirements]
    How well the system delivers its functionality. These requirements are
    related to the performance, scalability, availability, recovery time,
    security, and others.

  \item[Usability Requirements]
    These relate to how effectively, efficiently and satisfactorily users can
    achieve their goals in the existing system. User interfaces can play a big
    part in meeting these requirements.
