TODOs
=====

- Implement Logging 

- on `MainMenu`: find a more elegant way to handle the navigation between menus
  -- at the moment the `other.visible` way is not the most efficient.

- on `ManualEntry`:
  - make date field more elegant -- now it's free text...
  - make currency field depend on depend on
    `businesslogic.transcaction.Currency` but not directly
  - make the breakdown box work like on requirements


What I would like to do if I have the time
-------------------------------------------
- Make the application more user friendly, and decorate it properly;
- create an interactive wireframe version of the application and allow it to be
  live so that examiners can 'play with it';
- use multithreading to optimise categorisation;
- describe the benefits of the Scala Swing package, even though it is now
  largely not supported.
- introduce more modern tools such as hibernate and spring to the code;
- create a web interface rather than just using swing;
